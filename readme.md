## Dataset

> Citi bike is a public bike-sharing system and it is now owned by Lyft. Lyft operates Citi bike around New York City, and Jersey City, NJ. Citi bike bicycle sharing system was opened in May 2013 with 332 stations and 6,000 bikes. Due to the high volume of growth rate, Citi bike is expanding around the five boroughs of NYC. As of July 2017, there are 130,000 annual subscribers. The average is 48,315 rides per day in 2018. Rides per day/week/month/year are still growing rapidly. 
I have done this data analysis on NYC Citi Bike. I have gotten the data from *citibikenyc.com.* The dataset I used was from Feb 2020. There are about 750 stations around New York City and New Jersey. The daily average ridership is 48,315. Most people use Citi bikes for commuting. 


## Summary of Findings

> There are 22,962 users who rented Citi bikes in February 2020. Top 3 start stations are Grove St PATH, Sip Ave, and Hamilton Park. Top 3 end stations are Grove St PATH, Sip Ave, and Harborside. Some data types have been cleaned. Most males rent Citi bikes than females or unknown gender. Most of them born between 1975 and 1990. There are more subscribers than regular customers who use Citi bike. The average trip takes 600 seconds which equals 10 minutes. The highest number of customers takes bikes from 12 to 8 pm while subscribers (annual) take bikes from 7 pm to 9 pm. Those riders who are between 35 and 50 years old, take bikes for a long period of time. Most males and females take Citi bikes on Wednesday while unknown gender takes bikes on Saturday or Sunday.
